# Clustering-for-Data-Analysis

This project is a comprehensive endeavor aimed at analyzing and clustering seismic event data in Indonesia. By leveraging various attributes
such as depth, magnitude, and geographic location, the project seeks to uncover underlying patterns in earthquake distribution. With over
9000 data samples, the analysis aims to provide valuable insights to enhance preparedness and mitigation strategies for earthquake
disasters in the region.
